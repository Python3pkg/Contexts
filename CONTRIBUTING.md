I keep my to-do list [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/uPgp50AF/contexts-development).
Anything in the 'To-Do' list with a 'bug' or 'quick-fix' label is probably a good
place to start. If you want to do something from the 'Ideas' list, you feel one
of the tasks requires more elaboration, or you want some help with the code-base,
you're welcome to [contact me via email](mailto:benjamin.hodgson@huddle.com).
